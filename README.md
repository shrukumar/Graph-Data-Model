## GRAPH DATA MODELS (SQL AND NOSQL)
This is an assignment for DS 4300 where I was asked to implement graph data models in Python using Redis. First, I familiarized myself with the SQL model and made queries to answer several questions. 
Then I mimicked the SQL model with Python and Redis, which led to a much more efficient and simple model.

Here is the diagram that this assignment was based on.
